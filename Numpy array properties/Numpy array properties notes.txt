âœ¨ Quick Summary of Methods:

Method	Full Form	Meaning	Use Case
shape	â€”	Dimensions of array (rows, columns, depth)	To understand array structure
size	â€”	Total number of elements in array	To check total data points
dtype	Data Type	Data type of array elements	Useful before doing calculations
astype	As Type	Converts array to another data type	To change floats to ints or vice-versa
ndim	Number of Dimensions	How many dimensions array has	To detect 1D, 2D, 3D etc.
ðŸ”¥ Important Points:
astype() always creates a new array; original array remains unchanged.

shape does not give the number of elements, size does.

dtype is crucial while performing mathematical operations (e.g., float arrays vs int arrays).

ndim helps you reshape or index arrays correctly.
