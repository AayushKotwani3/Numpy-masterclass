## 📚 Learning Path

The folders in this repository are arranged in a progressive learning order. Start from the top and work your way down:

### 1️⃣ **📁 Creation**
Learn how to create arrays using functions like `np.array`, `np.zeros`, `np.ones`, `np.arange`, and `np.linspace`. This is the foundation of all NumPy operations.

---

### 2️⃣ **📁 Numpy Array Properties**
Understand the basic properties of arrays including:
- `shape`, `ndim`, `dtype`, `size`
- Data type conversions
- Memory layout of arrays

---

### 3️⃣ **📁 Indexing and Slicing**
Master the core of data access using:
- Basic and advanced indexing
- Slicing 1D and 2D arrays
- Fancy indexing
- Boolean masking and conditional filters

---

### 4️⃣ **📁 Reshaping and Manipulation**
Learn to reshape arrays using:
- `reshape`, `flatten`, `ravel`, `resize`
- Stack and split arrays with `hstack`, `vstack`, `split`, `hsplit`, etc.
- Insert, delete, and append values to arrays

---

### 5️⃣ **📁 Numpy Operations**
Dive into powerful mathematical operations including:
- Element-wise arithmetic
- Aggregation functions: `sum`, `mean`, `min`, `max`, `std`, `var`
- Sorting, comparisons, and statistical summaries

---

### 6️⃣ **📁 Broadcasting and Vectorization**
Learn how NumPy automatically expands smaller arrays to match larger shapes:
- Broadcasting rules and use-cases
- Replace loops with vectorized operations for better performance

---

### 7️⃣ **📁 Handling Missing Values**
Explore techniques to handle incomplete or invalid data:
- Use of `np.nan` and `np.isnan()`
- Replacing missing values
- Filtering or imputing data

---

### 8️⃣ **📁 Mini Project - Restaurant Dataset**
Apply everything you've learned in a real-world scenario:
- Load a restaurant dataset using NumPy
- Clean and preprocess the data
- Perform analysis and compute statistics
- Generate insights using slicing, masking, and aggregation

---

## 🧠 Why Learn NumPy?

NumPy is the **core library for scientific computing in Python**, and it's the foundation for other libraries like Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. Mastering NumPy gives you a **huge head-start** in data science, machine learning, and AI.

---

## ✅ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy (install via `pip install numpy`)

---

## 📌 Tips for Best Learning

- Clone the repo and run the code snippets locally.
- Modify examples and observe how the results change.
- Try out extra exercises at the end of each file.
- Use Jupyter Notebooks for a more interactive experience.
